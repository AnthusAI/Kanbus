    "description": "Package kbsc as a VSCode extension so that developers can view the Kanbus kanban board for the current project directly inside VSCode, without leaving the editor. The extension spawns kbsc as a child process for the API backend, and loads the existing compiled React console app in a VSCode Webview panel. No changes to the existing React app are required — API calls are redirected via fetch/EventSource patching injected into the Webview.",
