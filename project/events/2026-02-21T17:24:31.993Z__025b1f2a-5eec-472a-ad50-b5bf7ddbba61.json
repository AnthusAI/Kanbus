    "description": "As a developer, I want the extension to manage the kbsc server lifecycle automatically so that I don't have to start it manually.  Acceptance Criteria (BDD):  Scenario: Server starts when the board is opened   Given the extension is active in a Kanbus workspace   And kbsc is not currently running for this workspace   When I run the 'Kanbus: Open Board' command   Then the extension finds a free port   And spawns kbsc as a child process with CONSOLE_PORT set to that port   And waits for 'Console backend listening on http://127.0.0.1:{port}' on stdout   And shows a progress notification while starting  Scenario: Server stops when the extension deactivates   Given kbsc is running as a child process of the extension   When I close VSCode or deactivate the extension   Then the kbsc process receives SIGTERM   And the port is released  Scenario: kbsc binary is not found   Given kbsc is not on PATH   And kanbus.kbscPath is not configured   When I run 'Kanbus: Open Board'   Then I see an error message explaining how to install kbsc or set the path  Scenario: User configures a custom kbsc path   Given kanbus.kbscPath is set to '/opt/kanbus/kbsc'   When I run 'Kanbus: Open Board'   Then the extension spawns '/opt/kanbus/kbsc' instead of looking on PATH  Implementation: Create src/kbscProcess.ts. Auto-select free port via net.createServer().listen(0). Parse port from kbsc stdout (console_local.rs:245). Set cwd to workspace folder so kbsc finds .kanbus.yml automatically.",
