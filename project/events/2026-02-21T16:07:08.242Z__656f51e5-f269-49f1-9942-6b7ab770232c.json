    "description": "The kbs CLI reports version 0.6.0 (from Cargo.toml) while the actual semantic release version is v0.11.0. The Cargo.toml version is only synced during CI release, so local builds always report a stale version. The binary should derive its version from the latest git tag at build time so it always matches the semantic release version.",
