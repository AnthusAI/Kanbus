    "description": "As a developer, I want the kanban board to match my VSCode color theme so that the board does not clash with my editor appearance.  Acceptance Criteria (BDD):  Scenario: Board uses dark theme when VSCode is in dark mode   Given VSCode is using a dark color theme   When I open the Kanbus Board   Then the board renders with dark background and light text   Because the injected script reads vscodeThemeKind and sets the 'dark' class on the html element  Scenario: Board uses light theme when VSCode is in light mode   Given VSCode is using a light color theme   When I open the Kanbus Board   Then the board renders with light background and dark text  Scenario: Board switches theme when VSCode theme changes   Given the Kanbus Board is open in dark mode   When I switch VSCode to a light theme   Then the board re-renders in light mode automatically   Because a MutationObserver watches for changes to data-vscode-theme-kind  Implementation: Add theme sync logic to the injected script in KanbusBoardPanel.ts. Read document.body.dataset.vscodeThemeKind, set dark/light class on html, observe mutations on the body attribute.",
