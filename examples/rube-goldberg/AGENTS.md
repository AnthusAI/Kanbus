# Agent Instructions

## Project management with Taskulus

Use Taskulus for task management.
Why: Taskulus task management is MANDATORY here; every task must live in Taskulus.
When: Create/update the Taskulus task before coding; close it only after the change lands.
How: See CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md for the Taskulus workflow, hierarchy, status rules, priorities, command examples, and the sins to avoid.
Performance: Prefer tskr (Rust) when available; tsk (Python) is equivalent but slower.
Warning: Editing project/ directly is a sin against The Way. Do not read or write anything in project/; work only through Taskulus.
