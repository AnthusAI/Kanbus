      <voice>What if your project tracker was just files in your repository? No SaaS login. No per-seat costs. No external database to maintain.</voice>
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>Kanbus is a lightweight issue tracker that lives entirely in your Git repo. Issues, plans, and execution stay connected in one place—right next to your code.</voice>

    <cue id="one_file" label="One File Per Issue">
      <voice>Every issue is a single JSON file. Not one giant file that causes merge conflicts every time two people touch it—one file per issue.</voice>
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>That means your team and your AI agents can create, update, and close issues in parallel without stepping on each other. Hash-based IDs make collisions impossible, even when multiple agents are creating tasks at the same time.</voice>
    </cue>

    <cue id="no_friction" label="No Friction">
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>There's no database server to maintain, no background process to crash, and no complex synchronization logic. Each command just scans the project files directly.</voice>

    <cue id="agent_native" label="Agent-Native">
      <voice>Kanbus is designed from the ground up for AI-assisted development. Your agents can read and write issues through the CLI, exactly the same way a human developer would.</voice>
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>No API keys. No web latency. Just native file and command-line access to the full project tracker.</voice>
    </cue>

    <cue id="wiki" label="Live Wiki">
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>Kanbus also includes an integrated wiki with live templates. Use Jinja2 expressions to inject real-time lists of open tasks directly into your planning docs. When an agent reads a plan, it sees the current state of the project—not a stale snapshot.</voice>

      <voice>Already using Jira? Kanbus syncs with it. Pull your Jira issues into the repository so your agents always have the full context locally, without needing Jira credentials or API access.</voice>

    <cue id="local_tasks" label="Local Tasks">
      <pause seconds="0.3s" />
      <voice>And for your own work-in-progress, local tasks stay off Git until you're ready. Draft ideas, experiment, and promote tasks to the shared board when they're ready for the team.</voice>

    <cue id="implementations" label="Implementations">
      <voice>Kanbus gives you three ways to work. A Python CLI that installs with pip—perfect for scripting and AI tool integrations. A Rust CLI for high-performance use in CI/CD pipelines and large repositories. And a web console: a single binary with an embedded React frontend. Download it, run it, and you have a full Kanban board—no configuration, no npm, no separate assets.</voice>
